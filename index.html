<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>You are deciding how to split a $1000 bonus with your colleagues. Here are the rules:</p>
<ol>
    <li>If you and your colleague both cooperate and play nice, your boss will split the $1000 and give you $500 each.</li>
    <li>If you betray your colleague by complaining about them to your boss, your boss will trust you and give the full $1000 to you, but also take $500 away from them.</li>
    <li>However, if both of you decide to betray each other, your boss will be angry and take $1000 away from both of you.</li>
